**_ Using genomic data to Infer Mechanistic models for Complex traits _**   
- Multivariate methods cannot handle dimensionality - overfitting! (A drawback of GWAS)
	- Combining signals over multiple positions, when effect size is really small (dimensionality much larger than number of samples)  
- i) Disentangeling disease causal factors from treatment influences
	- genotype to celular traits (eQTL studies)
		- How do SNPs impact gene regulation and interaction
- ii) Integrating different data for deriving mechanisms

##eQTL studies
- cis-eQTLs vs trans-eQTLs
	- DGN study (genotype + GE from blood, 1000 individuals)
- Deconvolving technical factors' influence on data
	- Top 30 PCA of rna seq data vs set of technical factors (correlation matrix)
		- Some of the top PC don't correlate with any of the confounding factors
	- ** Y' = Y + (F x B) + (Z x V) + eI **
		- true exprn data + known factors + confounding factors
		- Accounting for hidden vars shot up number of potential candidate genes with significant signal as cis-eQTLs, from 10 (raw data) to > 700!
