# Notes  

## Readings   
1. [Putting the hourse back in front of the cart](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.07-03-0017)  
2. [Five characteristics of learner centered teaching](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/effective-teaching-strategies/five-characteristics-of-learner-centered-teaching/)  

- Most common approach to course design: make list of topics and then develop lectures to cover the progression of ideas falling under the scope of these topics.  
	- Topics generally chosen and guided with a textbook  
	- Topics limited by alloted meeting time for course  
	- Expect science literacy and *critical thinking* to automatically be part of design decisions.  
- But this may seem to the student as a *disorganized way to understand the material* because of such bloated goals.  
- Backward Design Model alternative  
	- What do we want the students to eventually understand with the course?  
	- What constitutes demonstrated competency/gain in understanding?  
	- Which approaches will promote understanding, interest, and competency in the subject matter?  
- Show *Where* the ideas are hooked, *hook* the students, *explore* the subject, and *equip* the student to explore....eventually giving students a phase to *rethink* their work and ideas, and *evaluating* them for the same.  
- It is NOT reasonable to expect a typical person to reasonably grasp all the topics, subtopics and vocabulary that are generally designed into a course, within the context of an ongoing learning experience.  
	- Evaluate the topic's importance to science literacy, in proportion to the amount of time students will need to spend understanding the key ideas in it.  
- *Learner centered teaching* must include explicit skill instruction (can't assume that students will pick up these skills themselves)  
	- Explicitly teach concepts (like problem solving, evaluating evidence, analyzing arguments)  
	- Challenge student assumptions about how they are expected to learn (have them critique/analyze what they learn and **how they are learning it**).  
	- Give students some power in choosing *how* they learn.  
- Wnat to understand *what the student knows and can do, that they couldn't do prior to taking the course*.  

### Things to eventually understand  
Appreciate basic facts/terms/concepts; apply them to novel, concrete situations or problem solving ; connect ideas and subjects by adapting what one knows to new contexts ; analysing by breaking down a whole into component parts and explaining how each part contributes to the whole ; being able to use evidence to evalaute mertis of ideas and materials (learning how to ask and answer questions)   

### Evaluating demonstrated gain in understanding  
- Either based on a criteria (like exams or quizzes, or writing), but administered reiteratively so progress can be monitored.  
	- **I'm thinking** the summary writing and shortening every 2 weeks can be a good way to assess this.  
- Observing students working together (class dialogue, journals, class discussions)  
- Performance tasks: concrete demonstration of ability to perform an analysis/procedure  

### Methods promoting understanding   
- Ex, if you expect students to eventually be able to make connections between ideas, *they need opportunities to practise and develop their skills for doing so*.  

## Video  
- Learning, not just doing.  
- What is the reason for studying something? (inspiration)  
- What qualities let us assess we know this?   
- What activities let us build and strengthen these qualities?  

- Requiring uncoverage?  

# Class Notes  
- What to do when students don't know what they don't know?  
- How do we ensure learning outcomes are met in a small class size?  
- How do we work with students that have very different motivations for taking the course?  

## Day 1's learning goals   
- Big Ideas for the course  
	- Learning context and situational factors that are relevant to you, the learner, and the curriculum  
	- *How will students learn?* is the only thing you really have influence over as an instructor  
		- Have the students feel challenged (learning something!)  
		- ** What are your students texting their friends WHILE they're in class? **
	- Use student diversity as an asset, not a challenge  
	- What are the students' needs? Where are they headed?  

## Notes from Class Discussion  

- Peer review and open results sharing  
	- How is the feedback imbibed by the students (is there dialogue? a rubric to refer to? or is it just a mark?)  
	- Sharing outcomes openly can impact students if feedback from public is negative. Best to keep it within the scope of the class?  
- Discussing controversial topics  
	- The style of the activity can impact what topics students feel comfortable confronting.  
	- The background knowledge can also influence what they find controversial vs not.  
	- Easy grade vs actual challenging task (need to balance this as an instructor).  
## Student Diversity Integration  
- We seek: Belonging + Relevance + Diversity of Experience  

### Belonging  
- The student sees themselves in the presence in the class  
	- Letting them choose readigns vs providing shared readings  
	- Creating group agreements / debates  
	- Common interests?  



- End of semester activity works towards a common theme (teach your grandma / podcast / ted talks / interviews)
