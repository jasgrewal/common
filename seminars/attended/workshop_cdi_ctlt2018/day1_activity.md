# Identifying Essential QUestions and Understandings  
## Topics & Big Ideas  
Special Topics in Bioinformatics  
## What essential questions does this raise?   
**What do you want your students to come to understand specifically?** 
- How is a special topic different from a methodology?  
- How does bioinformatics utilize software development?  
- What is the role of biology in bioinformatics? Does it simply generate data?  
- What is NGS and how has it shaped bioinformatics?  
	- Are the subtopics in bioinformatics isolated specialties?  
- How do bioinformatics topics interact with a typical sequencing pipeline?  
- If NGS approaches did not exist, how would that have impacted the subtopics that dominate bioinformatics research?  

### Essential Questions  
- What is bioinformatics? What is it not?  
	- Do biological questions drive bioinformatics? Or do technical artefacts drive bioinformatics? Or neither?  
- How do / what biological factors lead to special topics in bioinformatics?  
	- How do we assess whether bioinformatics has answered a biological problem?  

### Essential Understandings  
- The development of a sequencing and NGS analysis pipeline is core to all bioinformatics topics   
- Biological experiments and computational algorithms can both influence the output of any bioinformatics project  

# Big Ideas Manifested   
## Concepts  
- DNA isolation and sequencing  
- short-read vs long-read sequencing   
- Assembly    
- Reference genomes  
- Variant analysis  
- Technical vs Biological artefacts   

## Themes  
- Studying disease using computational methods   
- Types of biological material  
- Molecular basis of disease  
- Drug development  
- Population Statistics and predictive modelling (?)  

## Issues or Debates  

## Problems or Challenges  

## Processes  

## Theories  

## Paradoxes  

## Assumptions or Perspectives  
- WGS is more relevant than WXS  
- Microarrays are outdated  
- OLC approach is the best assembly method
