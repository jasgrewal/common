# Revising Learning Outcomes  
...and hanging out in the sandbox of iterative development  

## The 'what': Aligning outcomes, evidence, assessment  
1. Evidence  
	- Can be results only ('low level')  
	- Explain why / be able to apply knowledge / reflect on result   
	- *We don't always have to GRADE the evidence/outcome*, it just may be something you want to know as it is a course outcome: NOT ALL ASSESSMENTS HAVE TO BE GRADED  

*Cognitive Domain*: If writing to 'know', then include exercises to explain same information to different domains   
*Affective Domain*: If understanding distortion/biases, then include exercises including critical feedback on model being used  

2. Assessments  
Informal checks -> Observations + dialogues -> Tests, quizzes -> Academic prompts/projects -> Performance tasks/projects  
**If I'm expecting a high level of performance,** am I actually building them up for it?  

## Assessment OF, FOR, and AS learning  
- Summative Assessment   
	- Two Stage Exam (Individual component, and then same questions discussed/debated as a group of 4-6). Keeping individual score if it is higher than group score.  

- Formative Assessment


[Creating Rubrics](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/assesslearning/rubrics.html)  
- Single Point Rubric, [like this](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/single-point-rubric/)   
- Using rubrics is a way of giving detailed feedback.  
   


### Improving Learning Outcomes  
KNOWLEDGE:  
1) Identify the difference between a bioinformatics specialty and a set of computational algorithms
2) Identify and explain key computational methods for sequence assembly and analysis  
COMPREHENSION & ANALYSIS:  
3) Explain the biological relevance and relative merits of data types generated by 1st and 2nd generation sequencing platforms
4) Outline a bioinformatics based analytical pipeline, integrating key fields and methods

Application:  
?? (Use learning in new and concrete situations: apply / demonstrate/ solve)  
? Illustrate the integration of bioinformatics specialties in answering biological hypotheses and justify the selection of methods and data types  

Evaluation:  
?? (Judge value of material for a given purpose: assess / evaluate / justify)  
 
- Getting to synthesis requires these knowledge and comprehension tasks  

### Questions  
- How do you evaluate participation in big groups?  
- Communicating grading to graduate students (vs undergrads)   
- Discriminating resistance from confusion in the room  
	- Assessments in the middle of the course  
	- Tying in the course/resistant material to other courses or the program as a whole  
	- Understanding the behaviour and patterns of the students (reading the room)  
- Is there a drawback to using a rubric as a means of peer feedback?  

### Nice succinct concepts for learning assessment  
- Levels of belief about learning (content based resistance vs world view based resistance)  
- Unconsciously incompetent vs Consciously incompetent vs Consciously competent vs Unconsciously competent
- Checking in with students regularly, empathize with tough tasks and eventually get to point in course where we overcome the resistance/confusion together. Getting to that point is crucial though!  
- IRL you will never be locked in a room for 3 hours and be judged on how you perform a task during that time.  
	- **Give students similar opportunities** to practise, feedback, revise, and perform  
 
# Solid ideas   
- Having a Pre-Survey: Starting the course with assessing student skills (what is the skillset in the room, what do they know, what are the gaps?)  
	- Doing the pre-survey can also lead to raised expectations (now everyone's gaps will be filled), or pessimism (if these are the things I should've known and I don't know them, well shit...).  
- How do you keep the course focused and not let there be feelings of disorganization?  
	- The *lecture* is the core, will not change  
	- The *assessments* change, with choice of assignments or personalize for students  
- Get students to *Read, Write, P2P review (wrt writing themselves)*.  

- Take home assignment around sequence analysis  
	- Accompanying questions to explain application of material that has been covered in class (ex. what type of assembly algorithm? How'd the results be different if we do strand specific sequencing? what are the OTUs / what do they tell us?)  
- Blog of the week (news and views?): experiences and reports from the scientific community in Vancouver, from the perspective of new trainees  
- For the writing assignment (shortening summary iteratively)  
	- Make target writing for same purpose, to *different audience*  
	- Think about justifying style and language for target audience  
- Informal assessment:
	- Muddiest point / what did I learn best from today's lecture ([Exit Ticket](http://www.theteachertoolkit.com/index.php/tool/exit-ticket))  
	- Peer Feedback based on a rubric for every Field Review (we don't see it, they go to the student directly)   
- In class discussion has no right or wrong answer  
	- Grading on speaking up and voicing an opinion, be able to debate/stand up for their opinion vs quality of contribution  
	- Imbibe quality of discussion into final grade
