# Revising Learning Outcomes  
...and hangng out in the sandbox of iterative development  

## The 'what': Aligning outcomes, evidence, assessment  


### Questions  
- How do you evaluate participation in big groups?  
- Communicating grading to graduate students (vs undergrads)   
- Discriminating resistance from confusion in the room  
	- Assessments in the middle of the course  
	- Tying in the course/resistant material to other courses or the program as a whole  
	- Understanding the behaviour and patterns of the students (reading the room)  
- Levels of belief about learning (content based resistance vs world view based resistance)   

### Nice succinct concepts for learning assessment  
- Unconsciously incompetent vs Consciously incompetent vs Consciously competent vs Unconsciously competent
 
# Solid ideas   
- Having a Pre-Survey: Starting the course with assessing student skills (what is the skillset in the room, what do they know, what are the gaps?)  
	- Doing the pre-survey can also lead to raised expectations (now everyone's gaps will be filled), or pessimism (if these are the things I should've known and I don't know them, well shit...).  
- How do you keep the course focused and not let there be feelings of disorganization?  
	- The *lecture* is the core, will not change  
	- The *assessments* change, with choice of assignments or personalize for students  
- Get students to *Read, Write, P2P review (wrt writing themselves)*.  

- Take home assignment around sequence analysis  
	- Accompanying questions to explain application of material that has been covered in class (ex. what type of assembly algorithm? How'd the results be different if we do strand specific sequencing? what are the OTUs / what do they tell us?)  
- Blog of the week (news and views?): experiences and reports from the scientific community in Vancouver, from the perspective of new trainees
