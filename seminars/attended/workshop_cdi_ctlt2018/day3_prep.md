# Tying things together  
## Course Level Learning Outcomes vis a vis assessment  
1. Read a scientific paper in order to identify the main take-aways, critically study the methods, and evaluate the results.   
2. Identify and explain the core principles of bioinformatics specialties, and distinguish them from computational algorithms.   
3. Identify the types of biological data that can be processed within bioinformatics research areas and be able to enumerate the merits and limitations of each.   
4. Demonstrate knowledge of how data that may arise from 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation sequencing methodologies, and identify the advantages/limitations of each.    
5. Outline and defend a typical bioinformatics based analytical pipeline, integrating key specialties and methods.   


# Solid ideas  
- Splitting course into units  
	- week 1: Typical experimental design in bioinformatics, and separating the paper into parts (2 Stage Exam activity for reading a paper, followed by 20 minute overview ppt by TA on course design/breakdown of topics)  
		- Individual reading of same paper (perhaps have 3 paper sets, for 3 eventual groups?), with an accompanying worksheet/standardized form that they use to document how much time spent per section, which section read first, write down what they thought the central take-away from the paper was  
		- 5 minute break to discuss with person next to them, or to refect. Then join group with same paper (groups of 4), outline their own approach, what sections were most important, which section most irrelevant, which sections lead them to the discussion.  
		- Split and mix up groups with different papers in same group, share outline and convey central idea (is there a central/common idea?) / Share with class  
	- week 2-3: Reading papers and parsing them (emphasis on peer feedback - summarize at end of week 3)   
		- Use powerpoints for 1st week  
		- Explain by yourself for 2nd week (same paper)   
	- week 4-10: Field Reviews and Presentations  
		- Every week's FR presenters pair with last week's one to identify one common method or theme that is shared between their topic and the prev week's.  
		- On the 7th week of the FRs (overall week 10), have the last pair give a theme link, and have week 1's FR people work with last week's FR people to give a summary of all the links covered in the last 7 weeks    
	- week 11-12: Summative Assessments and Group Presentations    

- *Mind Maps*: With a marker, students can go around looking at what others have done and mark what they find relevant/puzzling
