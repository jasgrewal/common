# Tying things together  
## Course Level Learning Outcomes vis a vis assessment  
1. Read a scientific paper in order to identify the main take-aways, critically study the methods, and evaluate the results.   
	- 2 stage reading and interpretation of paper activity (make 2 stage exam be peer learning instead), worth 1-2% of grade, Week 1  
	- **UNSURE** Presenting papers to peers, trial activity for Weeks 2-3 (use powerpoints, and then once without any aids)  
		- Accompanied by single point rubrics filled out by peers  
	- Individual presentations on published papers, with peer and instructor feedback provided (weeks 4-10)  
	- **UNSURE** Iterative summarization of assigned papers over the course of 12 weeks (2 pages - 1 page - 0.5 page - 2 sentences)  
		- Students summarize for different target audiences (Their PI, colleague in class, grandparent, uncle/aunt, elementary school)  
		- Followed by peer to peer review? Or instructor assesses at every submission point.  
		- Students think about justifying style and language for target audience.  
2. Identify and communicate the core principles of bioinformatics specialties, and distinguish them from computational algorithms.  
	- Field Review presentations + current paper presentations (Weeks 4-10)   
3. Identify the types of biological data that can be processed within bioinformatics research areas and be able to enumerate the merits and limitations of each.   
	- **UNSURE** Embedded in specialties  
	- Mind Maps identifying shared themes between consecutive weeks on specialties' field reviews  
		- Field Reviewers of consecutive weeks discuss and identify shared link between current and previous week's topics, And then highlight it either as a group summary shared online previous to the class ( **UNSURE** ) or in 10 minutes prior to beginning of class.   
	- Group presentation (Weeks 11-12) on 'cool paper' that is centered around an instructor specified theme  
		- Theme imbues computation and biological parts together, or requires integration of multiple specialties or data types  
		- End of semester activity works towards a common theme (teach your grandma / podcast / ted talks / interviews)   
4. Demonstrate knowledge of how data that may arise from 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation sequencing methodologies, and identify the advantages/limitations of each.    
	- Class Discussions  
	- Class Pop-Quizzes (5-10 minutes) with questions directly testing these aspects   
	- Exit Ticket strategry to track learning and areas lacking confusion  

5. Outline and defend a typical bioinformatics based analytical pipeline, integrating key specialties and methods (The real *WHY* of the discipline).   
	- Group presentation (Weeks 11-12) on 'cool paper' (see Objective 3's point related to this)  

## Notes on Informal Learning and Assessments   
- Exit Ticket strategy for confusing days/topics   
- Peer Feedback based on a rubric for every Field Review (we don't see it, they go to the student directly)   
- In class discussion has no right or wrong answer, and imbibe the quality of the discussion into the final grade instead.  

# Solid ideas  
- Splitting course into units  
	- week 1: Typical experimental design in bioinformatics, and separating the paper into parts (2 Stage Exam activity for reading a paper, followed by 20 minute overview ppt by TA on course design/breakdown of topics)  
		- Individual reading of same paper (perhaps have 3 paper sets, for 3 eventual groups?), with an accompanying worksheet/standardized form that they use to document how much time spent per section, which section read first, write down what they thought the central take-away from the paper was  
		- 5 minute break to discuss with person next to them, or to refect. Then join group with same paper (groups of 4), outline their own approach, what sections were most important, which section most irrelevant, which sections lead them to the discussion.  
		- Split and mix up groups with different papers in same group, share outline and convey central idea (is there a central/common idea?) / Share with class  
	- week 2-3: Reading papers and parsing them (emphasis on peer feedback - summarize at end of week 3)   
		- Use powerpoints for 1st week  
		- Explain by yourself for 2nd week (same paper)   
	- week 4-10: Field Reviews and Presentations  
		- Every week's FR presenters pair with last week's one to identify one common method or theme that is shared between their topic and the prev week's.  
		- On the 7th week of the FRs (overall week 10), have the last pair give a theme link, and have week 1's FR people work with last week's FR people to give a summary of all the links covered in the last 7 weeks    
	- week 11-12: Summative Assessments and Group Presentations    

- *Mind Maps*: With a marker, students can go around looking at what others have done and mark what they find relevant/puzzling
