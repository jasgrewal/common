# Project management elements  
Aim is to ensure control of scope and time, assess risks, establish good communication.  
One can always get more time, but not more money.  

## What is a project?  
It is a temporary endeavour, the activities and goals become progressively more detailed/elaborate, and is unique (generates a unique outcome not done before)  
Progressive elaboration is changing the way you get to your goals, **not** changing the goals.  

## Principles  

## Lifecycle of projects  
- Inititaion / planning / executing / monitoring / closing  

Closing is an important *but often overlooked* part of project management. Need to have a project 'post-mortem' and capture what things worked well, what did we learn, did the work itself get done?  
	- Carry forward lessons from project to related projects / new initiatives  

# Project components  
## Initiation  
**THE IDEA PHASE**  
**The Strategic Question**: What problem are we trying to solve? (short-term gain, and long-term goal)
How will this project answer that? (assess feasibility, risk of alternative ideas, and then plan this project)  
This is the 'narrowing it down' phase.  

Any scenario can be broken down into multiple smaller projects, but need to find goldilocks zone so that the management of individual projects doesn't become overwhelming and take away from addressing the original strategic question.  
	- Does the overall project hinge on all the components? Then it's a project by itself.  
	- Grant writing + associated project will be 2 projects, the writing and then the actual research. The research *may then have multiple components*.  

### Knowldge areas  
- Quantitative & Processes   
- **Time** & **Quality**   
- **Scope** & Risk  
- Procurement & **Cost**   
PM: Integrate these keeping in mind human resources, stakeholders, and communication between them.    

Need to strike a balance between scope, time, cost, and quality. (See accompanying powerpoint Slide 26)  
	- In this, if we decide scope is most important component, we can tweak other components so that scope remains same.  
	- Similarly for cost, or quality, or time as the **driving priority**.  

## Project Planning  
**Documentation**  
- Have a formal approved document to *manage execution*  
	- Not a step-by-step for the project, but how the steps will be managed.  
	- Ex. don't need to know what software is being developed, but basically how long it will take, the cost, meric for evaluating that this has been completed (managing the project goal)  
- Clearly stated **objectives**  
	- What are you going to *do*  
	- Should have attribute (cost, quality, time), metrics (cost, time in months), absolute value (cost, quality, time)  
- Clearly stated **deliverables**  
	- Tangible, verifiable work products  
	- These will *get the project to its objective*  
	- Important to set **SMART** goals to fulfill objectives. Each goal can include multiple deliverables.  
- Be aware of **constraints**  
	- For ex, an employee can only work on Tuesdays and Wednesdays on a new tool  
		- If schedule is the driving priority, you hire and train someone else  
		- If quality is the driving priority, you increase time dedicated to tool  
- Be aware of **assumptions**  
	- A guess about an activity that affects work performance  
		- Ex. access to resources  
		- Effect of outcomes of previous activities (!! Particularly relevant in research setting !!)  
 
**Thinking about Stakeholders**   
- Individuals who influence the project  
	- The project will impact them  
	- They will impact the project by ways of decision-making and external involvement  
	- They are actively involved with the project  
	- They are interested in project execution/outcome  
	- Can be any of the above  
- Can be classified based on interest and influence (powerpoint slide 51)   

- Need to consider their **Requirements and Expectations**  
*Requirements* are usually very specific, quantifiable, and may involved forms to be filled out.  
*Expectations* are implicit and qualitative, so for this particularly, we need to spend time **at the planning stage** to find ways to measure **expectations**.  
	- By managing expectations, we can also ensure that **Interested parties** don't end up being the **influencers**.  

## Project Execution  
### Risk Management  
**Evaluating risk**  
- Uncertain event that has a positive or negative effect on objectives  
	- Can be opportunities or threats  
	- Technology, and Competition, can be risks!  
- The 6-3-5 analysis (in a group of 6 people, each writes down 3 taking 5 minutes, pass to left, add new etc). Powerpoint Slide 65.  
- The SWOT analysis (discuss strengths before weaknesses so people are psychologically more inclined to be honest about their weaknesses/limitations of the project idea)  
- Prioritize risks based on *impact* and *probability*  

**Managing risk** 
- Can manage preparing how to manage the risk *when* it occurs (because **it will occur**)  

### Establish Scope of work  
What work is needed?  
- This includes defining what to do, and **what work NOT to do**.  
	- Manage work so that we don't end up doing work that we haven't planned to do, and achieve our objective.  

Scope Planning follows from the strategic question, product description, and project charter, eventually culminating into the **Scope Statement**.  
	- Includes objectives, deliverables, supporting info, and scope management plan.  
The Scope Management plan includes all activities do to ensure the scope remains....within the scope!  
	- Includes progress reporting, milestone reviews, quality control, and establishing processes for change.  

#### Scope Creep  
When we have poor scope planning or control, we end up with unnecessary work incorporated into the project, as many little changes.  
This can result in project disruptions and REWORK (think about shopping at Costco...).  
BUT! If you accept these changes as being necessary to the project, you have **Scope change**.  

#### Scope Change  
This is progressive elaboration, and is in fact essential to any project. If our approach is not working, it'll be foolish to keep doing it just because the project plan says so.  
- At that point we elaborate and change the scope.  
Thus, we need to rely on early results from the project to develop scopes that are suitable to the project.  
 
### Quality Management  
*Better is the enemy of good enough*  
- Ensure that the project outputs meet the objectives  

Customer satisfaction, and prevention vs inspection (QC vs QA).  
Quality control entails measurement of quality during the project (we are not taking steps to change anything at this point).  
 
### Managing time  
- Schedule management  

## Controlling and Monitoring  
### Changes that can happen  
Internal, external, or progressive elaboration (happened, imposed, or chosen)  
- If we have opportunity to incorporate change early in the project, the chances of adding value are much higher than the risks/costs/detrimental effect.  
	- As we get closer to the end of the project, changes are more likely to be *destructive intervention*.  

### Incorporating changes  
- Identify what will change  
- Document why, and the impact on schedule and budget  
	- Document this elsewheres, not as part of your plan  
- Confirm quality objectives  
- Then implement the change and then track the impact  

This may require some gymnastics with the budget. In that case, consider elements in the budget that you can delay/reduce, and based on the significance/importance of the change, incorporate it into budget (more on this next week).  
## Project Closing  
How do you know you're done?  
- Compare deliverables to objectives, requirments and expectations  
- Get agreement from stakeholders  
- Post implementation review
