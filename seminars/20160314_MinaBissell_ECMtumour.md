Role of the ECM and the microenvironment in cancer

###RSV virus and chickens
- Only when embryo starts developing (immune system changes) do you see neuplasms (mild), or in petri dish. Not in the chicken or embryo though
	- **context matters** : microenvironment (Dolberg et al, Science, 1985)  

###Cancer as an organ specific disease
- BRCA1 leads to BRCA, Ovarian; APC leads generally to colon cancer
	- **Question:** not a cell type specific disease? 
- How's this tissue specificity maintained, and how do we study this in mammals?  
	
####Mammary gland as a mammal
How does it remember to be a mammary gland? Hmm....   
- Myoepithelial cells in the mammary gland are the **true tumour suppressors**  
- Structural organization and induction of polarity in the cell (Joanne Emerman's work)
	- **Lr-ECM** as a 3D culture emulating breast structure (*Barcellos-Hoff et al, Development 1989*)
		- Laminin 111 and Basement membrane <- need myoepithelial cells  
		- and it realises it's a mammary gland! Damn....  
		- This 'realization' missing in malignant mammary gland cells
- **It took 20 years to develop a first model of BRCA outside humans, in mice**  
	- **Question:** thoughts on use of xenografts? How to assess differences in tissue microenvironments in mammalian models?  
	- Found that **structure goes before malignancy develops** in mice
		- So if you restore tissue polarity in tumor cells with abnormal genomes, can they become phenotypically normal?  
			- malignant cells have same receptors, but balance is off (5x EGFR, integrins, versus normal). *(Weaver et al, JCB, 1997)*  
			- Use inhibitory therapy to revert to phenotypically normal. Note that reversion is itself reversible (**phenotype dominant over genotype**)  
				- **Question: ** How does this affect the fitness landscape of these cells? Do some clones die out? What 'collapses in'? **   
		- If you destroy basal membrane during development, you can lead to tumour development
			- **_Follow up on papers published on this by Dr. Bissell _**  

- If you use the right combination of inhibitors, you can revert metastatic cell lines
	- How then do we define an **oncogene**?
		- Everything has a context (Wang et al., JNC, 2001)  
	- **oncogene addiction**  

###Form and function are related
- Why EGFR therapies work for some, make others resistant
	- Lee et al, JCI, 2012 (found FAM83A family)  
- Bissell et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst, 1972 (more glucose uptake by malignant cells)  
	- Extracellular glucose level could determine the malignant phenotype (Yasuhito Onodera et al, JCI, 2014)

- Reversion is a form of dormancy
	- dormant BRCA cells lie on top of blood vessels. Wherever the blood vessels are sprouting, the cells start growing again
