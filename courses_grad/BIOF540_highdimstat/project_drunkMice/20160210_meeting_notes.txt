Q1. What can we find from the expression dataset comparing treatment and genotypes, and combined effect (G + tx + Gxtx)
(ILS+EtOH)
(ILS+Saline)
(ISS+EtOH)
(ISS+Saline)
Linear regression comparisons between these.

Q2. Variance is biological and technical. 
Don't expect a high technical variance 
{3 mice in a blender -> RNA -> library -> (flowcell1, flowcell2, possibly flowcell3)} == (9 flowcells encompassing the 4 different treatment+genotype sets) x 3 replicates
Is there variance on a gene-by-gene basis between the technical replicates?
Account for 'noise' in the input datasets. 
*notes*
- RNASeq : 
	expression <- all reads mapped over a gene (approach 1, count based)
	expression <- all reads over gene / (length of gene x avg reads per million) (approach 2, fpkm)
	How do approach 1 and 2 differ / change output
Feature reduction?

Q3. Recombinant inbreds 
(ISS x ILS)
RI1...RI30
Expect a spectrum of relationships between these samples. Are there any patterns that can be derived from exploring this dataset? For example, correlation between phenotype and genotype?

*Pre-processing already done*
Quality trimming
Mapping (Tophat 2)
Read counting using HTC (ignoring reads that map to multiple positions)

STEPS
1) Data preprocessing
*Possible avenues for pre-processing*
Size factor correction (total mass, median, quantile)
FPKM
LFC transform -> Normalize
Hierarchial clustering

2) Variance
- Feature reduction (Gene set size reduction)
- (co)-variance between technical replicates**

3) Differential Expression (Apply to both part 1 and part 3)
- Two way ANOVA in parents (ILS, ISS)
- K-means or k-medoids clustering
