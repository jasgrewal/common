Step up procedure: Sorts p values in descending order, compare threshold at each p value point, once we find the threshold p-value, all hypotheses with p values below that will be considered significant (identically, anything upwards = true nulls). Controls Family Wise Error Rate strongly.

FDR: Instead of controlling FWER, control false positives over the number of false detections you're making. Since number of FP is unknown, aim instead to reduce the expectation of false positives. 

Max-T permutation test: Strongly controls FWER! 

Brain decoding (34): Use Max-T permutation test
