#Towards inference of fitness landscapes in human cancer   

##Looking at a mutational profile  
Robust statistical inference in studying biological systems izzz important.  
**Boveri (1914)** initially observed correlation between proliferation in plant cells that have an extra chromosome. First commentary on human malignancies being based off of our genome itself instead of extrinsic factors.  
**Nowell and Hungerford (1960)** discovered the Philadelphia Chromosome.   

Even tissue samples from healthy patients' eyelids are replete with genetic mutations (natural mutagenic process happening over one's lifetime).   
**TCGA**: First phase complete, 25 major subtypes sequenced, 100,000 tumours.  

###Dealing with site-specific classification of cancers  
*C. Kandoth et al, Nature 502. 333-339 (2013) doi: 10.1038/nature12634*   
- Basket trials underway, addressing whether, what if, two cancers have a similar mutation profile (ex. V600E mut in BRCA, and in CRC; latter is a totally different cell type, same system? Not really....jury still out on this)  
- Epigenetic reprogramming, splicing have been revealed by unbiased mutational screening across all cancer types.  

###Identification of mutations in cancer  
*MS Lawrence et al. Nature 000, 1-5(2013) doi:10.1038/nature12213*  
- Very cool **bagel plot**   
- **Exogenous factors**: Enriched C->A pattern of mutations in lung cancers (first hand smoke), C->T pattern of mutations in melanoma.  
- **Endogenous factors**: APOBEC proteins have a particular mutation profile in cancers (Tp*C -> mut)   
- EGFR mutations are markers of resistance to therapy, oftentimes  
	- EGFR muts for anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors  
	- BRAF V600E in melanoma for vemafurenib  

##Classes of genomic aberrations   
- Point mutations  
	- Oncogenic mutations - **hotspot mutations**  
	- Loss of function mutations (in tumour suppressors) - distribution of mutations in all across the gene  
- Genomic rearragements   
	- Create chimeric genes or gene fusions, novel proteins  
	- BCR-ABL1 (promoter exchange). This sort of behaviour is seen in lymphoma frequently, for example.  
	- Gene fusions in sarcomas *translocation events).  
- Copy Number Changes  
	- Breakdown in recombination repair mechanisms usually leads to high CNV profiles  
	- ERBB2 CNV gain in BRCA - target for *Herceptin*  
	- PIK3CA and PTEN mutations tend to be *mutually exclusive* as they are part of the same pathway, too much disru
ption in it tends to be difficult to 'live with'

###When genome instability **IS** the phenotype  
- Ex. KRAS mutations, BRCA+p53  
- High grade serous ovarian carcinomas exhibit massive genomic instability  


##Novel cancer gene discovery  
- Ding et al, 2015.  
	- 12 tumour types, >2700 tumours  
	- Association study  
- Roth et al, Nature Methods 2014 (PyClone)  
	- Priors on clustering and prevalence estiamted using MCMC  
- Ali Bashashati, Gavin Ha J Pathol 2013  
	- Serous ovarian cancer, different sites based sequencing  
- McPherson, Roth et al, under review  
	- *Variation in composition and diversity across sites*  
	- Diversity may be tolerated differently in different sites, in the same patient  
	- **Very interesting!** follow up on this later.
