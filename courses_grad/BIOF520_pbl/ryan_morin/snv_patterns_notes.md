#SNV distributions (Patterns of mutations, signatures)
*Genome wide scale: influenced by cellular factors  
*Locally: DNA sequence context (role of flanking sequence...albeit unclear)  
- Sequence context dependent mutagenesis at A-tracts and G-tracts (Bacolla et al, 2015)
	- Are abundant in vertebrate genomes; mutations within the tracts occur more frequently than genome wide average, and increase with increasing tract length; 
	- **Length instability is a hallmark of mismatch repair-deficiency in cancers** and occurs due to slippage during semiconservative DNA replication (repeat misalignment)  
	- SNVs occur predominantly at 1st and last base pairs of A-tracts
		- Coincides with the most flexible base pairs for A-tracts
	- SNVs occur predominantly at 2nd and 3rd base pairs in G-tracts
	- Likely based on base-pair flexibility, charge transfer (both local DNA features and long range base-base interactions)
	- Ex. mutator role of activated induced deaminase (AID) in B-cells during class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, targets preferentially cytosines within {A,T}{A,G}C  

**European samples have an excess of deleterious variation versus African populations**  
- Deleterious alleles were enriched in runs of homozygosity (Szipech et al, 2013)  

##Patterns of mutations  
- Greenman et al, 2007  
- 1000 somatic mutations, in 274 megabases of DNA (==518 protein kinase gene exons), in 210 human cancers. 73/210 showed no somatic mutations at all!  
- Evidence of driver mutations contributing to development of the cancers studied in approx 120 genes.  

*Biological selection is exerted mainly on non-synonmyous mutations as they may alter the structure and function of proteins*  
- Microsatelite instability (failure of DNA mismatch repair mechanism)  
	- Signaure C>T transitions, C>A transversions  

##Signatures  
- Alexandrov and Stratton, 2014  
- Earliest one from UV radiation (C>T, CC>>TT)  
- mutational signatures of carcinogens are left as 'evidence' in cancer genomes (TP53 studies in early 1990s)  
- Aflatoxin (known carcinogen, found in food from south Africa and Asia!!) in hepatocellular cancers, C>A transversions  
- Normal cellular event of 5'mC demethylation results in some C>T mutations at CpG dinucleotides has been observed in all cancer types  
- *Temozolomide treatment (alkylating agent) significantly elevates the # of somatic mutations and results in a distinct mutational pattern of C>T transitions. 
- Several signature transversions associated with error prone polymerase (n, e)
- 6 classes of somatic substitutions (4 distinct processes with different mutational signatures) based on time of development.
	- Initially all mutations in the cell are due to activity of endogenous mutational process

	- The final cancer genome doesn't resemble any of the operative mutational signatures
