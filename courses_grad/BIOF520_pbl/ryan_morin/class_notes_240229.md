Exome capture: Probes/baits (Illumina RNA)
- Multiple probes per exon
- No diff in library prep from WGS, do same lib prep but mix with probes and then run PCR
- Cheaper than RNA-Seq? Depends on types of RNA-Seq you want to do, depth.	
	- RNA-Seq does not address mutation discovery per se
	- Expression profiles of germline vs somatic tissue sample will be quite different
	- Lack of coverage of some genes that are not expressed at all in other areasof the body, whereas is in some areas
	- Alternative splicing and annotations not handled well currently, artefacts from that could mess that up (alignment artefacts and pseudogenes)
- Actually don't have a clue about distribution of inversions
