#Make a pipeline
- Clearly identify goals and what goes in, what goes out at each stage  
- 

#Discussion
- nosocomial: Is hospital acquired  

##Identify hospital acquired infections  
###Sources
- Patients identified at 
- 
###Nature of sample
- A new patient walks in with potentially antibiotic resistant strain associated symptoms  
	- Sequence that sample  
	- Run additional tests  
		- Throat swab? What other swabs?  
	- For any patient that walks in  
		- see if they have physical symptoms of infection  
			- If yes, swab them  
				- If anything comes up, culture  
				- Swab location based on site of infection (throat? blood?)  
- Culture on antibiotic media
	- Whatever is left is sequenced  
- Other tests (rapid genotyping)  
	- qPCR 
	- DNA Strip test  
	- microarray  
	- Culture on antibiotic  
	- other hybridization based methods that do not rely on DNA amplification or culturing? **Hybridization based genotyping**   

###Modes of acquisitoin of resistance  
- Resistance mutations  
- Impermeable barriers  
- Outer membrane eflux pumps  
- Drug modification  
- Intracellular/extracellular resistance   

###Mode of transmission   
- Air  
- Touch   

###Other things to think about
- Does a library prep for targeted antibiotic resistance screening exist already?  
	- Gram positive versus Gram negative   
- Other methods for rapid genotyping that exist currently?  
	- qPCR, PCR strips, DNA microarrays  

#Assessment of results  
- If results come back negative from 3 independent tests (or could go with 1 rapid response test response), they are indicated as tentatively negative (wait for culture based confirmation)  
- What are the protocols for quarantine?  
- If culture comes back positive and the rapid tests come back negative, review rapid test sets to see what we missed.   

##Which antibiotics to test for  
- Classes of antibiotics tested out  

##Sequencing  
- Assemble and map?  
- Reference guided assembly?  
- After assembly with AbySS, annotate, homology search with antibiotic classes.  
- Add annotation tracks for *De Novo* assembly   

#Issues  
##Unculturable bacteria?? :o  
- Pathogenic microbes are able to grow in harsh conditions  

##Pre existing antibiotic resistant bacteria in hospital acquired infections?  

##Metagenomic sequencing (Plan B)  
- Sequence and find any existence of homologs of antibiotic resistant sequences, straight up.  

##Can you track the course of transmission  
- Can you trace when a transmission took place? With what accuracy?  
	- Patient 0  
- Social contact network  
- Phylogeny  

##How does a phylogenetic tree of extant species differ from a transmission network?
