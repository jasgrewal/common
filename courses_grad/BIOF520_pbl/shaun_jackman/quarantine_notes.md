#Background notes  
Focus is on communicable diseases.   
In medieval Venice, forty days (quadraginta is latin for 'forty') was the length of time for which human immigrants were separated from the general population to limit the spread of bubonic plague.   
- Location based screening (known areas where infection found, people from those areas are pre-screened)  
	- Lower social strata people have stronger control (**SARS**)  
	
#Isolation   
- Used for ill people  
- Criteria for isolation can be based on signs, sympotoms, or lab criteria  

#Quarantine   
- Restricts movement of well people who may've been exposed to a communicable disease until it can be determined if they are ill.  
- **Compulsory separation** , duration of assessment of *no longer being a risk to others* can be based on time elapsed from their potential exposure.  
	- Exceed the incubation period of the bacteria  
- **In Canada, publich health authorities asked persons who might have been exposed to SARS to voluntarily quarantine themselves**  

#Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  
- Currently apply quarantine and isolation at **federal** level to cholera,  

#Ebola  
- Travellers with Ebola like symptoms are immediately isolated and sent to a hospital for examination  
	- If they're released by the hospital, they will still be required to self-monitor  
	- Can choose to send returning **medical worker** to go into *home quarantine*  for **21 days**    
- **Active Monitoring**: post arrival monitoring of travelers  
- **Direct Active Monitoring**: Daily direct observation of healthcare workers by public health officials.
