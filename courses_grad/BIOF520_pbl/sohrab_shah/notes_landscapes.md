- *From fitness landscapes to seascapes: non equilibrium dynamics of selection and adaptation*  
- **Positive selection != adaptation**
- Evolutionary equilibrium
	- Beneficial changes still occur, repair previous deleterious changes and restore existing functions
	- **Adaptation** is a non-equilibrium response to changes in selection
		- genomic response to time-dependent selection 
		- Requires surplus of beneficial substitutions over deleterious ones
	- **Majority of beneficial mutations identified by population-genetic tests have moderate selection coefficients**
		-  A weakly beneficial change might just compensate a previously fixed weakly deleterious change, without any change in selection
- Look at yeast and Drosophila genomes
	- How can you infer adaptive evolution, in the presence of positive selection? 
- Molecular evolution
	- Non synonymous mutations (amino-acid changing ones) are under negative selection (demonstrated by substantially reduced substitution rates compared to synonymous mutations)  
	- Regulatory elements
		- **A Sweep**, rapid fixation of a selected mutation, reduce polymorphism of linked polymorphic loci in its neighbourhood
