##Cancer phylogeny assumptions
- The initial set of mutations sits at the top
	- Deletions that coincide with mutations that don't fit in the tree that well, can be leveraged through an integratvie or post-processive model be used to understand if those mutations followed a particular evolutionary model.
	- Max likelihood tree given a set of mutations and their prevalence 

##Time Series
- mutation of higher cellular prev came before mutation with lower cellular prev.  
- Tree additivity constraint: as you ascend the hierarchy, the sum total of the clonal prevalence should equal the sum of the descendants.   
- If your population changes so drastically that subclonal populations are no longer present, you may have some parents in the t2 point not annotated in phlogeny attained from t1.  
- *A clonal phylogeny* can be present at any of the timepoints in the time series, and can be measured to track clonal 

## Longitudinal patient studies
- Differences in selective environments in humans vs xenografts 
	- model life span (mice don't live that long)
	- Zhang 2013 : propagated xenografts in successive generations
	- Influence of ECM? 
	- Doesn't tend to be good at recapitulating metastatic events from humans
		- Different patterns of metastasis
		- good for evaluating tumour cell lines' response to therapy and drug resistance

##Xenografts
###GEM mice
Modulate driver mutation candidates in mice at birth, and wait for mice to develop tumour.  
Mice microenvironment has a lot of influence on tumours <- orthopic transplants can be used as a workaround (instead of subcutaneous injection). You can also transplant human stroma.  
- bioengineering and human stroma?
- BLT humanized mice (take human blood or bone marrow and inject in immuno-compromised mice) 
- It depends on the immunodeficiency, the type of mice you're using
- Essentially don't have human tumours developing, but the tumour development may closely mimic what's going on in humans. 
###Xenograft mice

##ctDNA
- better representation of the tumour clonal composition
- germline foundation for sensitivity vs resistant tumour populations
	- STAT3 genein Japanese populations, for ex.  
	- Would need to correct for demographics as well
	- Need 10's of 1000's of samples  

###If you studied the tumour, what can you look for in the two groups
- SNVs
- CNVs 

###The notion of a tumour mutating
- In a resistant clone, did it already exist prior to therapy or did it occur as a byproduct of therapy?
	- Many drugs that are mutagens themselves
	- consensus is that there is an already existing resistant clone

##Drift versus Selection
- Population dynamics measurements, and accounting for neutral mutations
	- Sample size and how they'll contribute to accrual of neutral mutation
	- Looking at mutational prevalence among different patients 
		- Synonymous, random mutations
	- If you have pouplations A, B, C, D, what about if A has a higher survival advantage
		- Likelihood ratio test assuming positive selection in Ha, versus genetic drift causing mutation accrual in H0

##Epistatic mechanisms
- RNA-Seq can help understand the clonal evolution  
	- scRNA and scDNA seq from same pool, get the transcriptomic and mutational landscapes
