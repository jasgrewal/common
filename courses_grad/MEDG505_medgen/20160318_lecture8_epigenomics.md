# Role of epigenetic deregulation in development

- ChIP-seq was one initial application of solexa for studying DNA methylation.  

## Mammalian DNA methylation  
- 28 million CpGs in humans (for 1.2 billion bases): 70-80% of these methylated.  
- High CG density regions tend not to be methylated (promoter CpG Islands, 12K, 97% of these unmethylated)  
	- Note that specific regulatory context, mCpG is repressive.  
	- **DNA methylation** is **not a repressive mark**. Can be associated with higher transcription rates too.  
- Spontaneous deamination of Cytosine --> to preserve CG pairs, methylation
	- This is why AT rich genome in humans, presumably (mutagenized unmethylated Cytosine -> Thymine)
	- So dense CpG islands found because they're under selective pressure  

## Histone modifications
- Same mark, different methylation or acetylation pattern = different effect!  
	- Ex. H3K27ac is enhancers, H3K27me3 is Repressive  
	- H3K4me3 active promoter, H3K4me1 enhancer  
- Different influences on DNA expression and DNA methylation
	- H3K9me3 mark, lesser DNA methylation (for ex.)  

## Cool studies on epigenetic effects
- Dutch winter: [*in utero effect of epigenetics*](http://www.hongerwinter.nl)
- [Role of epigenetics in memory](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21245904)  
- Transgenerational epigenetic studies (Michael Zinner has worked on this in the context of environmental toxins) 
- Inheritance of epigenetic factors
	- Matt Lawrence (during development and early development, epigenetic reprogramming <- **Does not occur in cloned organisms**)  
	- Histone marks tend to persist (Research at UBC)  

# Epigenetics and Cancer
- Global loss, local gain of DNA methylation  
- ?Chromatin remodelling in Cancer
- IDH has a neomorphic mutation : Glioma  
	- generates an **onco metabolite** 
	- **potentially an initiating event**  
- Rhabdoid tumours are defined by biallelic SMARCB1 loss
	- pediatric cancers, deregulation of SWI/SNF complex  
	- SWI/SNF complex shifts nucleosomes around
	- renal or brain (rhabdoid or ATRT)  
- **CIMP** phenotype of methylation in CpG promoters
	- silences tumour suppressors
	- initially seen in colorectal cancers, also seen in pediatric cancers  

# Upcoming methosd
- MeDIP-seq
- MRE-seq  
	- use a cocktail of restriction enzymes blocked by methylation
- ATAC seq to identify open chromatin regions  
- Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS)  
	- Population wide methylation, hence a continuous range (50% methylation, 90% methylation etc.)
	- At a single cell level, methylation is a binary 
		- CpG methylation is **symmetrical**, so not hemi-methylated  
		- Imprinted genes are hemi-methylated  

## International Human Epigenome Consortium  
- Tissue specific epigenomes  
- 1000 primary human celltypes  
- 4 million individual specific methylation site variations  

## Future reading
- [Nature epigenome roadmap](http://www.nature.com/collections/vbqgtr)
- Vitamin C as an epigenetic modifier, recovery from leukemia
	- PMID 21885017 talksa bout TET enzymes, that are a class of epigenetic modifiers constantly mutated in cancer 
	- mESC exposed to Vit C showed massive increase in hmC (hydroxymethylation on Cytosine)  
		- Vit C activates TET
		- Inactivated TET leads to gain of methylation at CpG islands, suppressed tumour suppressor
