#High throughput single cell analysis of natural immune repertoires   
- Microfluidic tools for sc analysis  
- Search through an individual's repertoire of unique antibodies and get some high quality (?) antibodies  
	- These antibody secreting cells are difficult to grow in culture.  
	- Difficult to characterize
	- Company called **AbCellera**  
- Ion channel inhibitors and cow antibodies (have a special type of protrusion that attracts epitopes) - *Look this up later!*
