# Introduction  
Professor Matthew Farrer

In Trisomy 21, the event of chromosome 21 duplication can occur in meiosis 1, or duplication + no separation in meiosis 2. Either of these will have separate influence on the outcome/prognosis.  

Cannot do imaging for Lewy bodies yet. Can identify dopamine loss, amyloid accrual.

# Parkinson's disease
- Asymmetric condition that becomes symmetric over disease progression
- Neuromelanin
- Classified as a motor disorder but it's more than that
	- signs manifest 20-30 years earlier (Longitudinal studies in Japan)
		- Constipation is one!
	- Classification may work at funding level, but at etiological level this is not the case
- Profound depression in most affected
	- Family members of affected patients having suicidal tendencies? (Vancouver Island sample set)
	- REM sleep behaviour disorder ( --> Lewy body dementia)
- Literature catches up with the epidemiology
	- Environmental etiology was claimed to be causative initially
		- MPTP example in california (drug killed off certain neurons)
	- Now know about 50 different genes linked with Parkinsons
		- Mendelian mutations in familial parkinsons
			- {Late onset, young/early onset, atypical late onset, atypical juvenile}
			- Matt's focus is on late onset families
		- Even if it's the same mutation, different age of onset
			- Gene influences developmental patterns (slight changes, which are compensated for by the nervous system but gradually manifest themselves)
			- i.e. an age associated failure in compensation, that causes Parkinsons
	- Linkage studies (calculate LOD scores)
	- looking at allele size around an inherited mutation to identify trait heredity (Lrrk2 G2385R anestral risk factor for Parkinson's in Asia)
	- "Idiopathic" Parkinson's Disease

- **The rate of progresssion is still the same!**
	- 15 year difference in Parkinson's disease onset between Ashkenazi Jews (early) and New York Jews! 
		- Is there a modifier for age of onset? 
			- Lrrk2 p.G2019S AAO analysis
			- Age of Onset is also quite subjective
			- Symptoms could be constipation, fatigue, personal response varies to these as well, so....
		- *In case of the Ashk. vs NY Jews comparison*, is the subjective assessment of age of onset a confounder? 

### Controversial research? 
- Fighting over patients
	- Lytico boding of Guam

### Paper notes
- 23AndMe had 20 cases and 20 controls
